This web application checks for users in a 100km or less radius from a point of origin coordinates and their coordinates. The information from each user comes from a txt file that has each line in JSON-format. It then shows only the users that fulfil this condition.

* Ruby Version: 2.2.0

* Rails Version: 4.2.0
